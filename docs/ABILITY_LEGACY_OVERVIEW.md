# Ability Now vs Legacy

The Codex Vitae dashboard now tracks two complementary progression tracks:

- **Ability Now** reflects your current, verifiable capability across the six core stats (PWR, ACC, GRT, COG, PLN, SOC). Each stat ranges from 1–20, and the summed total maps linearly to a 0–100 Ability score. The circular meter on the dashboard shows today’s composite Ability, while every stat row displays a dominant major bar for the current value and confidence badge.
- **Legacy** captures lifetime contribution. Verified training loads, personal records, streaks, and badges accumulate toward a Legacy score that never decreases. Legacy converts into an open-ended level and perk budget; it does not directly change today’s Ability numbers.

**UI rule:** for every stat row, the main Ability bar (1–20) is visually dominant, and the stat’s Legacy contribution appears as a thinner bar directly underneath. The two bars always remain paired so players can distinguish “now” vs. “forever” at a glance.
