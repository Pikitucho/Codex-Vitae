# Avatar Placeholder Setup

To showcase the illustrated character that you shared, drop the artwork into the project and name the file:

```
assets/avatars/avatar-placeholder-casual-park.jpg
```

Recommended guidelines:

- **Format**: High-quality JPG or PNG. (JPG is preferred for the current configuration.)
- **Dimensions**: 3:4 aspect ratio around 1200×1600 px keeps the stage crisp.
- **Background**: Keep the surrounding park scene so the warm lighting in the dashboard blends naturally.

Once the file is in place no additional code changes are required—the dashboard will automatically load the illustration as the default avatar until a user scans or uploads their own model.

If you ever want to swap in an updated render, just replace the file with a new version using the same filename.
