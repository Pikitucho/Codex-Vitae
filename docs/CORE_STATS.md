# Core Stats System Overview

## Core Philosophy: Quantifying the Self

The Six Core Stats form the foundational attributes of every Codex Vitae character. They represent broad, underlying capabilities that summarize a person's potential and growth across major domains of life. Unlike Constellation Skill Tree perks‚Äîwhich reflect specific achievements‚ÄîCore Stats capture the innate power that makes those achievements possible. This separation ensures stats provide an immediate, at-a-glance portrait of development while fueling future integrations across the Codex Vitae multiverse.

## The Character Passport Vision

Core Stats are the immutable backbone of the Codex Vitae **character passport**. While the Constellation Skill Tree chronicles *what* a character has accomplished, the Core Stats define *who* they are at a fundamental level. Through the Gateway API, new games can read these stats directly, allowing real-world growth to manifest instantly in digital worlds. Every stat point earned is a lasting enhancement that empowers players to carry their Codex Vitae identity seamlessly across the multiverse.
