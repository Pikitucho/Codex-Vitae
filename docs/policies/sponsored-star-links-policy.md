# Sponsored Star Links — Policy (Ad Labeling & Neutrality)

## What are Sponsored Star Links?
Some Stars include clearly labeled **Sponsored** links from providers (e.g., courses, apps, schools) who pay for placement on that Star’s detail panel.

## Neutrality & user choice
- Sponsored links **never** change a Star’s requirements.
- Users **never** have to use a sponsor to unlock a Star.
- Every Star with sponsors also shows **non-sponsored** options and a **“Bring your own proof”** path.

## Labeling & placement
- Sponsored links appear in a separate, clearly labeled section: **“Sponsored options.”**
- Organic recommendations are listed **independently** and based on relevance.
- We cap sponsored slots to keep the interface clean (default: **max 3**).

## Privacy & data use
- We **do not** share personal data with sponsors without explicit consent.
- Sponsors receive only **aggregate metrics** (impressions, clicks, conversions if integrated).
- Users can manage ad preferences in **Settings → Sponsored Links**.

## Conflicts & eligibility
- Sponsors cannot influence Star criteria, outcomes, or user rankings.
- Baseline quality required (e.g., accreditation or consistently positive reviews).
- We may refuse or remove sponsors that violate brand or safety standards.

## Creator controls
- Constellation/Star creators can opt-in/out of sponsor slots for their content.
- If all sponsors are disabled, the block is hidden and organic recommendations remain.
